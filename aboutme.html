    <div id="about">
        <p id="aboutme"> I am a sophomore in university studying computer science. Outside of the classroom, 
        I am mainly involved in Manna Christian Fellowship. I really enjoy spending time with people and 
        getting to know them over meals or casual conversations/hangouts. When I'm not working or chatting with people, 
        I enjoy playing sports, especially spikeball, badminton, golf, and basketball. Additionally, I also enjoy having 
        jam sessions with friends, where I typically sing or play piano, guitar, or even guitalele (a guitar-ukulele cross). 
        I also play the cello and have participated in various orchestras in the past. Some things I look forward to doing 
        over the summer, when I have even more free time include improving my amateur cooking skills, listening to podcasts 
        (Tim Keller's Gospel in Life is a current favorite), and learning new skills (currently learning web dev, which is 
        why I made this site!)
